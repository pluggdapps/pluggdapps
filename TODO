* Netscale, figure out possible ways of exiting netscale platform (document
  them as well) and handle them gracefully inside pluggdapps (which
  will be executing as a separate port-process).

* Implement a native web server. Already there is an evented web-server using
  linux epoll mechanism. But it is yet to be ironed out and tested.
  Code is available in pluggdapps/evserver directory. Move the code to
  separate package and make it available as an IServer plugin.

* man sub-command for pa-script to show help text for interfaces and plugins.

* config sub-command for pa-script should include options to display settings
  help.

* Follow through
    http://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/
  and work out method-resolution-order using super().

* -*- coding:utf-8 -*- 
  should always be prefixed at the beginning of the file ?

* Add appropriate classifiers.

* Routing, resolve view callable based in media-type. The problem is there can
  be more than one view callable which differ only by their media_type
  predicate. We need a logic in routing code which used Accept request header
  field to choose the highest priority media_type based on qvalue.
