Tolerant application

   The line terminator for message-header fields is the sequence CRLF.
   However, we recommend that applications, when parsing such headers,
   recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore the leading CR.


Date encodings

   HTTP/1.1 clients and caches SHOULD assume that an RFC-850 date
   which appears to be more than 50 years in the future is in fact
   in the past (this helps solve the "year 2000" problem).

   An HTTP/1.1 implementation MAY internally represent a parsed
   Expires date as earlier than the proper value, but MUST NOT
   internally represent a parsed Expires date as later than the
   proper value.

   All expiration-related calculations MUST be done in GMT. The
   local time zone MUST NOT influence the calculation or comparison
   of an age or expiration time.

   If an http header incorrectly carries a date value with a time
   zone other than gmt, it must be converted into gmt using the
   most conservative possible conversion.
