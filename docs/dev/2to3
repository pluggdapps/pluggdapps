Python manual says,

"On the other hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run
time â€” however, the language definition is evolving towards static name
resolution, at "compile" time, so don't rely on dynamic name resolution!
(In fact, local variables are already determined statically.)

So to make sure that the source base of pluggdapps and its dependant packages
have not taken the runtime black-magic for granted, check for the following
code patterns.

* Usage of functions like globals(), locals(), vars() to effect a namespace
  behaviour
* Using __dict__ on objects.
* Importing modules and packages in un-expected ways.
