* Python 2.7 is the last 2.x major release.

* Support for 2.7 is expected to end sometime around 2016.

* Interesting features like string handling (unicode), concurrency, are
  available only in 3.x releases

* Supporing both 2.x and 3.x leads to kludge in source base.

* There is a moratorium on python feature additions giving developers in 2.x
  to catch up with 3.x

* Not to mention that it feels better to program in p3k, given the fact that
  substantial cleaning up has been done to standard library as well.
